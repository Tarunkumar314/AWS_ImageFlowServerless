# AWS_ImageFlowServerless
This project creates a serverless image processing system using AWS. Users upload images via an API Gateway, triggering AWS Lambda for processing (e.g., resizing). Images are stored in S3, and metadata (URL, size) is saved in DynamoDB. The system is fully serverless and scalable using AWS services.
